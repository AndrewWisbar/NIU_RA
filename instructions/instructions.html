        <h3 class="instr-header">Getting Started</h3>
            <p class="instr-body">
                When the webpage is first loaded, the computer will begin by attempting to identify all of the objects present in a randomly selected image.
                Once the computer thinks it has detected each important object in the image, it will display this information by drawing rectangles corresponding to each detected object. 
                That is where the user's job begins.
                The computer can only guess at the location of objects and what type of object it is. It doesn't know for certain, and will therefore, often be wrong. 
                It is the users job to correct the computer, so it can learn to make better guesses in the future. 
            </p>
            <p class="instr-body">
                To do this, a user should start by correcting any rectangles the computer may have generated.
                This could include rectangles which are not completely covering a detected object, mislabeled rectangles, 
                or even the computer drawing a rectangle where no object is present.
            </p>
            <p class="instr-body">
                Once all the necessary corrections have been made to any generated rectangles, 
                a user should move on to selecting any significant objects in the image that the computer may have missed.

            </p>
        <h3 class="instr-header">Editing Computer Generated Content</h3>
            <p class="instr-body">
                The webpage provides many tools one can use to edit the computer's detected objects, 
                and each of these tools can also be used by a user to edit selections they have made.
            </p>
            <h4 class="instr-sub-header">Moving and Resizing</h4>
            <p class="instr-body">
                Perhaps the most useful of the available tools is the ability to move and resize rectangles.
                To do this, begin by selecting the desired rectangle. 
                This can be done by simply moving the mouse within the bounds of the rectangle. 
                When a rectangle becomes selected, its borders will become slightly thicker, and 
                five small <span style="background-color: var(--highlight)">colored</span> squares will appear,
                one in each corner, and one in the center. Clicking and dragging one of the squares in a corner 
                will allow you to move that specfic corner, and clicking and dragging the middle square will move
                the entire rectangle without changing its shape.
            </p>
            <h4 class="instr-sub-header">Renaming Rectangles</h4>
            <p class="instr-body">
                Another very useful tool is the ability to re-label, or rename a rectangle. 
                To do this, simply right-click on the target rectangle and select the "Rename Rectangle" option.
                Once you do this, a text input box will appear underneath the image. 
                Type the desired label into the box and click sumbit.
            </p>
            <p class="instr-body"> 
                The name of a rectangle is important because it is how the computer knows what an object is. 
                The computer doesn't really know what a word like "person" means, 
                but by analyzing all the images it has that are labeled "person",
                it can begin to guess at what the connections between the images are.
                Then the computer can apply these connections to new images to hopefully detect
                each person present.
            </p>
            <h4 class="instr-sub-header">Deleting Rectangles</h4>
            <p class="instr-body">
                Yet another tool is the ability to delete a rectangle. To do this right click on a rectangle select "Delete Rectangle." 
            </p>
        <h3 class="instr-header">Selecting Image Content</h3>
            <p class="instr-body">
                To select a part of the image, simply click and drag anywhere on the image. 
                The rectangle will be drawn between that point and where ever the mouse is released.
            </p>
        <h3 class="instr-header">Selecting Text</h3>
            <p class="instr-body">
                To select a word from the caption, first, highlight the word by clicking and dragging. Then, right-click the selection and choose "Highlight Selection" from the context menu.
            
                After the text has been highlighted, you can click and drag the highlighted text. When you drop the highlighted text onto a rectangle, it will create a link between that rectangle and word.
            
                Using the context menu, you can also remove a highlight, or remove any links the word may have. Alternatively, links can be deleted individually by right-clicking the link itself.
